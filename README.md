# Unity-Project-1
This is my first Unity Project 

This is a running game with a side camera view.
The player can jump and double jump to avoid obstacles

There is one powerup where the player becomes invincible to all objets but it remains for a small amount of time (during this duration a fire kind of vfx will appear and 
will disappear when the duration is over)

There are background music and running animations,jump animations

Please note that this part of the Unity Learn Tutorial.
Most of the assets and vfx were provided in the course and the others were taken from Unity Assets Store

I learnt the coding part and did it myself.
